\section{Reseach Background}
The interplay between global commerce and environmental sustainability has escalated into a prominent area of scholarly investigation, reflecting the growing complexity of international trade's impact on ecological systems (\supercitet{RN123}; \supercitet{RN166}). In the wake of increasing global interconnectedness, 2022 saw international trade account for more than 30\% of global GDP, while also contributing significantly to global carbon emissions—exceeding one-quarter of the total emissions (\supercitet{RN176}). This significant environmental footprint underscores the urgent need to explore the mechanisms through which global trade practices distribute pollutants across regions, particularly highlighting stark disparities in pollution levels between developed and developing nations (\supercitet{RN133}; \supercitet{RN161}).

Historically, the relocation of pollution-intensive industries from developed to less regulated developing regions has been perceived as a strategic move to circumvent stringent environmental laws, thereby raising critical questions about the actual environmental cost of free trade. This shift not only exacerbates the emission levels in developing regions but also complicates the global efforts to mitigate environmental impacts (\supercitet{RN169}). The global trade environment is further complicated by recent geopolitical events, including intensifying trade frictions between major economies such as the U.S. and China, Brexit implications, the establishment of regional trade barriers (\supercitet{RN160}), and significant policy enactments like the U.S. export controls. The onset of the 2020 pandemic added another layer of complexity, propelling nations towards an unprecedented level of protectionism characterized by severe trade restrictions (\supercitet{RN143}; \supercitet{RN111}).

Focusing on the U.S.-China trade dynamics as detailed in Table \ref{tab:timeline}, this research seeks to dissect the environmental outcomes of these economic interactions. As the two largest global economies and leading carbon emitters, the trade activities between these nations not only shape economic landscapes but also significantly influence global environmental policies and practices. In 2019, the U.S. and China accounted for 28\% and 14\% of global CO2 emissions respectively, with their bilateral trade constituting a significant portion of the world trade (\supercitet{RN180}). The recent trade disputes, marked by the U.S.'s CHIPS and Science Act and China's strategic export controls, offer a compelling case study to explore the environmental ramifications of these economic engagements.

The semiconductor industry occupies a unique position within the U.S.-China trade landscape, characterized by its high technological intensity and strategic significance. This sector not only drives significant economic value but also acts as a focal point in the technological rivalry between these two global powers. The intricacies of semiconductor trade between the U.S. and China are highlighted by the frequent shifts in policy, ranging from the U.S. imposing restrictions on semiconductor exports to China, to China's maneuvers to bolster its domestic chip manufacturing capabilities in response (\supercitet{RN180}). These dynamics are critical as they not only influence trade policies but also affect global supply chains and innovation trajectories in technology-intensive sectors.

The environmental impacts of this trade are multifaceted. On one hand, the advanced technologies used in semiconductor manufacturing require substantial resources, including water and energy, and involve the use of hazardous chemicals, which pose significant environmental risks if not managed properly (\supercitet{RN176}). On the other hand, the drive towards more advanced semiconductor technologies can lead to more energy-efficient products, potentially mitigating some of the environmental impacts associated with electronic devices' life cycles. However, the escalation of trade tensions and the resulting shifts in production locations may lead to environmental deregulation as countries compete for manufacturing dominance. This scenario can exacerbate the environmental costs in regions that may adopt less stringent environmental controls to attract or retain semiconductor manufacturing facilities. Thus, understanding the environmental outcomes of semiconductor trade requires a nuanced approach, considering both the direct impacts of manufacturing and the broader implications of global trade policies on environmental standards and practices.

This enriched backdrop serves as the foundation for this study, aiming to provide an in-depth analysis of how shifts in global trade policies, particularly those influenced by major geopolitical events, affect environmental outcomes. Through this lens, the research will examine the broader implications of international trade on global sustainability efforts, making it crucial to understand and possibly reframe the ongoing discourse on trade and environment in the contemporary global economy.

Figure \ref{fig:tech roadmap} illustrates the structured methodology employed in this thesis to analyze the environmental impacts of international trade, with a specific focus on the semiconductor industry, utilizing multi-regional input-output (MRIO) tables and environmental expansion accounts provided by Exiobase 3. The approach is divided into several key stages to ensure a comprehensive assessment of the trade-related carbon footprint.

Initially, the study extracts MRIO tables and their corresponding environmental data covering the years 2000 to 2022 for 200 products across 49 countries or regions. This extensive data extraction forms the basis for all subsequent analyses, offering a detailed and expansive perspective on global trade and environmental interactions.

Following data extraction, the study defines specific product categories related to semiconductivity, including upstream and downstream products. These categories are crucial for focusing the analysis on relevant sectors within the semiconductor industry. The research constructs three distinct no-trade scenarios to simulate the environmental impacts in the absence of trade. These scenarios are compared with actual greenhouse gas emissions data obtained through consumption-based accounting (CBA), allowing for a nuanced calculation of carbon uplift due to trade activities.

The core analytical phase involves calculating various elements such as total output ($X$), intermediate inputs ($Z$), final demand ($Y$), and the Leontief inverse matrix ($L$), which are foundational to understanding the economic interconnections within the MRIO framework. These calculations lead to the estimation of greenhouse gas emissions under different trade scenarios, including no-trade, no Sino-US trade, and a scenario incorporating gaming trade redistribution, which offers insights into potential changes in carbon emissions patterns due to strategic alterations in trade policies.

The final stage of the methodology involves a detailed visualization, comparison, and analysis of the data to draw meaningful conclusions and generate policy recommendations. This process not only elucidates the quantitative impacts of trade on carbon emissions but also provides a solid empirical foundation for suggesting strategic interventions to optimize trade practices for better environmental outcomes.

The technical roadmap, as visualized in Figure \ref{fig:tech roadmap}, is integral to demonstrating the systematic approach taken in this thesis to address the complex interplay between trade and environmental policies. This structured methodology ensures that the findings are robust, comprehensive, and relevant to policymakers and industry stakeholders engaged in navigating the challenges of sustainable international trade.
