   abstract = {In Japan, the Great East Earthquake caused numerous casualties and the subsequent suspension of operations at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant continues to have an adverse impact on the national energy supply chain. The structural changes in energy supply have served to reinforce the importance of national emissions accounting in promoting overall CO2 reduction policies. However, traditional approaches for evaluating industrial emissions have been criticized for their production-based perspective, which fails to consider emissions embodied in sectoral indirect consumption. The purpose of this study is therefore to understand the sectoral emission transfer. By applying economic input-output tables, detailed sectoral economic interactions can be usefully identified. It was found that the emissions embodied in final consumption generated largely by households. Besides, although emission intensity of manufacturing sector is extremely high in direct emission, agriculture sector is found to exceed other sectors in indirect emission intensities. From the consumption-side, these findings strongly suggest that a high priority be given to mitigation efforts aimed at reducing residential consumption, whist policy priorities are expected to be located on agriculture-related sectors from production-side. The study hence provides insights into how we can better allocate emissions responsibility and set reduction priorities among major economic sectors.},

   abstract = {Tyteca [J. Environ. Manage. 46 (1996) 281] reviews the literature on environmental performance indicators. In that paper he calls for an index that simultaneously accounts for resources used, good outputs produced and pollutants or undesirable outputs emitted. Here, we provide a formal index number of environmental performance which can be computed using data envelopment analysis (DEA) techniques. The implicit benchmark is that of finding the highest ratio of good to bad outputs. Our environmental performance index is constructed from distance functions which implies that it satisfies a number of desirable properties. Since the component distance functions require only information on input and output quantities, the fact that bad outputs typically are not marketed and therefore have no readily observable 'price' poses no obstacle. We apply our method to a sample of OECD countries for 1990. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The Malmquist-Luenberger (M-L) index has been used to assess environmental productivity growth with undesirable outputs, through applying directional distance function (DDF) to standard Malmquist productivity measurement. However, when calculating the cross-period DDFs, the M-L index has the same infeasibility problem as the Malmquist index does. To address this infeasibility problem, this paper discusses when infeasibility may happen and develops a modified M-L index that is based on a new DDF. We propose that the modified M-L index can be applied to assessing environmental performance at both macro-and micro-levels. At a macro-level, we evaluate China's growth in total factor productivity (TFP) from 1999 to 2012, accounting for undesirable impacts. The results show that technical change is the main driver of most TFP growth. The TFP changes support the status quo of a distinct gap in economic development among different regions. At a micro-level, we assess Chinese auto manufacturers' environmental performance from 2005 to 2012. The results suggest that Chinese automakers have enjoyed a noticeable TFP improvement, and that technical change is the major contributor as well. Taking together, reducing air emissions and other pollutants is an effective way of improving environmental productivity. As demonstrated, the proposed modified M-L index has proved to be consistently feasible and guarantees non-negative reference targets for all metrics. As a result, we recommend the modified M-L index as a robust tool for solving the infeasibility problem that is typical in conventional index and for assessing productivity under environmental impacts.

This new decomposition model calculates changes in emissions (the bad outputs) associated with changes in technical efficiency, technical change, growth of fuel and non-fuel inputs, and changes in the mix of good and bad outputs. This study finds that declining SO, emissions are primarily associated with changes in the output mix, while declining NOx emissions are associated with declining fuel consumption and changes in the output mix.

   abstract = {Asia-Pacific (APAC) has been the world's most dynamic emerging area of economic development and trade in recent decades. Here, we reveal the significant and imbalanced environmental and socio-economic effects of the region's growths during 1995-2015. Owing to the intra-regional trade of goods and services, APAC economies grew increasingly interdependent in each other's water and energy use, greenhouse gas (GHG) and PM2.5 emissions, and labor and economic productivity, while the environmental and economic disparity widened within the region. Furthermore, our results highlight APAC's significant role in globalization. By 2015, APAC was engaged in 50-71% of the virtual flows of water, energy, GHG, PM2.5, labor, and value added embodied in international trade. While the region's final demand and trade grew less resource- and emissions-intensive, predominantly led by China's transformations, APAC still lags behind global averages after two decades. More joint efforts of APAC economies and attention to sustainable transformation are needed.},

   abstract = {The BRICS economies group (i.e., Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) has become an important contributor to the growth of the world economy, which is increasingly concerned about carbon emissions due to the recent increase in energy use in these countries. While the embodied energy use related to emissions of the BRICS group has been discussed in the literature, an integrated analysis of energy, carbon footprints, and value added flows associated with international trade among the BRICS group has, to date, rarely been reported. Based on an improved Multi-Regional Input-Output model, South Africa was extracted from the rest of the world in the World Input-Output Database (WIOD) to analyze the above-mentioned flows embodied in trade within the BRICS countries, as well as between the BRICS group and other economies. The results show that the BRICS economic entity was a net embodied flows exporter. More flows were embodied in intermediate products than in final demand within the BRICS group. Compared with other BRICS economies, China, which is the largest transit country, transferred more embodied flows from Russia to other BRICS countries, and drove more embodied flows from major economies, including the United States and European countries outside the BRICS group than those within the BRICS group. However, China imported a relatively higher embodied energy and CO2 in per unit value added from the BRICS countries than non-BRICS countries, while exporting relative lower embodied energy and CO2 per value added to other BRICS economies than non-BRICS countries. The potential policy implications on cleaner development within the BRICS economies are discussed at the end of this paper.},

   abstract = {We have developed a new series of environmentally extended multi-region input-output (MRIO) tables with applications in carbon, water, and ecological footprinting, and Life-Cycle Assessment, as well as trend and key driver analyses. Such applications have recently been at the forefront of global policy debates, such as about assigning responsibility for emissions embodied in internationally traded products. The new time series was constructed using advanced parallelized supercomputing resources, and significantly advances the previous state of art because of four innovations. First, it is available as a continuous 20-year time series of MRIO tables. Second, it distinguishes 187 individual countries comprising more than 15,000 industry sectors, and hence offers unsurpassed detail. Third, it provides information just 1-3 years delayed therefore significantly improving timeliness. Fourth, it presents MRIO elements with accompanying standard deviations in order to allow users to understand the reliability of data. These advances will lead to material improvements in the capability of applications that rely on input-output tables. The timeliness of information means that analyses are more relevant to current policy questions. The continuity of the time series enables the robust identification of key trends and drivers of global environmental change. The high country and sector detail drastically improves the resolution of Life-Cycle Assessments. Finally, the availability of information on uncertainty allows policy-makers to quantitatively judge the level of confidence that can be placed in the results of analyses.},

Abstract = {The turn of the 21st century heralded in the semiconductor age alongside
   the Anthropocene epoch, characterised by the ever-increasing human
   impact on the environment. The ecological consequences of semiconductor
   chip manufacturing are the most predominant within the electronics
   industry. This is due to current reliance upon large amounts of
   solvents, acids and gases that have numerous toxicological impacts.
   Management and assessment of hazardous chemicals is complicated by trade
   secrets and continual rapid change in the electronic manufacturing
   process. Of the many subprocesses involved in chip manufacturing,
   lithographic processes are of particular concern. Current developments
   in bottom-up lithography, such as directed self-assembly (DSA) of block
   copolymers (BCPs), are being considered as a next-generation technology
   for semiconductor chip production. These nanofabrication techniques
   present a novel opportunity for improving the sustainability of
   lithography by reducing the number of processing steps, energy and
   chemical waste products involved. At present, to the extent of our
   knowledge, there is no published life cycle assessment (LCA) evaluating
   the environmental impact of new bottom-up lithography versus
   conventional lithographic techniques. Quantification of this impact is
   central to verifying whether these new nanofabrication routes can
   replace conventional deposition techniques in industry as a more
   environmentally friendly option.},
