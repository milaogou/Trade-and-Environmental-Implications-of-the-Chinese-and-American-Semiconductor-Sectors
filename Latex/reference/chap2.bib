   abstract = {Trade plays an important role in redistributing resources and also brings significant environmental impacts to involved countries. This relatively complex research domain of international trade and environmental burden shifts is informed through study of embodied environmental flows of products. Research trends to identify features of international trade embodied flows between 1997 and 2016 are determined through a bibliometric study. Research contribution of countries, authors, institutions and journals are described. Co-citation and network analyses are completed. Results show that there has been significant research interest increase on this topic. Given the interdisciplinary and global nature of this topic, increases in countries, author, and institutional collaborations has occurred. USA, China, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Norway were the top 5 countries with high academic influence, and country as USA and institution as Chinese Academy of Sciences has the largest number of collaborations, respectively. Embodied flows such as carbon emission and water are popular ones associated with international trade in the given period, and the most popular methodological tool is Input/Output Analysis. In addition, hotspots which extracted from keywords are analyzed, additional avenues of research are also discussed in this study.},

   abstract = {As a developing country, Indian energy scenario has perennially been plagued by problems like energy deficit, threats to energy security and low energy efficiency. Raising the supply of renewable energy is the key way for India to solve this dilemma. The formulation of effective renewable energy policies requires a comprehensive understanding of the evolution and drivers of the renewable energy consumption in India. Based on multi-regional input-output model (MRIO) and structural decomposition analysis (SDA), this study identified India's renewable energy consumption patterns and its transition drivers. The results shown that there was not much difference between the renewable energy consumption of India in the production-based and consumption-based, both of which were dominated by domestic consumption. However, the development of globalization had made the influence of international trade on India 's renewable energy consumption no longer negligible. Developing countries had gradually become the main destinations and sources of India's exported and imported renewable energy. From the perspective of driving force, in terms of domestic consumption, the upward influence of the unit growth of India's per capita final demand was weakening. As far as the renewable energy embodied in exports and imports, the energy intensity effect and the per capita final demand effect of developing countries had more contributions compared with developed countries. Therefore, India should attach more attention to the cooperation with developing countries in the field of renewable energy, and increase the efficiency and share of renewable energy consumption to offset the weakening of demand-driven.

   abstract = {The interest in consumption-based emission and resource accounting has grown significantly. Many studies juxtapose consumer emissions (carbon footprint) and producer (territorial) emissions of greenhouse gases in order to demonstrate the effects of trade on the national emission budget. To this end, a respectable number of studies have been undertaken worldwide in order to estimate emissions embedded in international trade of numerous countries and world regions. Input-output approaches, and increasingly multi-region input-output (MRIO) models, are commonly chosen as they provide an appropriate methodological framework for complete carbon footprint estimates at the national and supra-national level. With increasing processing capabilities of computers and a wider availability of economic accounts, environmental accounts and trade data such models are now being implemented on a wide scale. After a brief overview of salient single-region input-output studies I provide an in-depth review of the most recent multi-region input-output models used for the purpose of consumption-based environmental accounting. The main methodological features and important results are described for around twenty studies covering the years 2007 to 2009. This is followed by a detailed review of studies dealing with uncertainty in MRIO analysis, an area which has not received a lot of attention so far. I conclude that further research is mainly needed in two areas, a) improvements in data availability and quality and b) improvements in the accuracy of MRIO modelling. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we quantify the bad labor conditions associated with consumption in seven world regions, the "bad labor" footprint. In particular, we analyze how much occupational health damage, vulnerable employment, gender inequality, share of unskilled workers, child labor, and forced labor is associated with the production of internationally traded goods. Our results show that (i) as expected, there is a net flow of bad labor conditions from developing to developed regions; (ii) the production of exported goods in lower income regions contributes to more than half of the bad labor footprints caused by the wealthy lifestyles of affluent regions; (iii) exports from Asia constitute the largest global trade flow measured in the amount bad labor, while exports from Africa carry the largest burden of bad labor conditions per unit value traded and per unit of total labor required; and (IV) the trade of food products stands out in both volume and intensity of bad labor conditions.},

   abstract = {Our study illustrates how consumer social risk footprints can assist in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Combining the Social Hotspots Database (SHDB) and the Eora global multi-regional input-output table, we use input-output analysis to calculate a consumer social risk footprint (SF) of nations' imports. For our SFs, we select four indicators related to five of the UN's SDGs: gender equality (SDG 5 also 8.5 \& 8.8); mother and child health (SDG 3, especially 3.1 \& 3.2); governance (SDG 16, especially 16.5 \& 16.6); and access to clean water (SDG 6, especially 6.1 \& 62). After examining results for all four indicators we focus on gender equality to fully convey the value and limitations of using this method of analysis. Our study compares producer (domestic) social risk and consumer social risk footprints resulting from international trade patterns. Generally, developed countries show higher social risk footprints while developing countries show higher domestic social risks with the exceptions of UK and Ireland in the developed-world, and China and India in the developing-world. Details of the SFs associated with exported products worldwide reveal that Pakistan, Yemen and Iran have some of the highest SF risk, while Australia, Canada and Denmark are among the lowest. These results are important for the UN in developing partnerships to address the Sustainable Development Goals and for organisations such as the World Bank, Trade Unions and NGOs' work towards a fairer world.

Since most freshwater withdrawals are for agriculture, reliance on water embodied in imported food (trade in 'virtual water') is a possible strategy to provide food to water-stressed regions while conserving their scarce supply for other purposes. To evaluate this proposition, we extend a model of interregional trade by (1) defining endowments of water that cannot be exceeded, (2) allowing simultaneous operation of rainfed and irrigated agriculture, and (3) distinguishing sub-regional endowments within a larger economic region. An application to the Mexican economy compares region-specific water abundance with economic comparative advantage under alternative scenarios. We conclude that the water-rich regions of Mexico are relatively high-cost producers of food and that they do not pick up the slack even when the lowest-cost Mexican regions are constrained by binding water constraints.},

   abstract = {Trade boosts economic growth, but it increases carbon emissions embodied in trade. To achieve economic growth through trade without increasing carbon emissions, it is essential to determine the driving factors of economic growth and carbon emissions embodied in trade. This study uses the multi-regional input-output (MRIO), Tapio decoupling model, and structural decomposition analysis (SDA) to investigate the decoupling of carbon emissions embodied in the Sino-US trade and their driving factors. The results show that, first, the decoupling of carbon emissions embodied in China's exports to the US is relatively invariable and gradually improving. By contrast, the decoupling of carbon emissions embodied in the US exports to China is variable. Second, the effect of the intermediate product structure on carbon emissions embodied in the US export to China is higher than that of China's export to the US. Third, 5 industries in China that export to the US were in a strong decoupling state from 2013 to 2014, whereas knowledge-intensive manufacturing and service industries in the US that exports to China were in the best decoupling state. Fourth, the driving factors of carbon emissions embodied in trade between China's export to the US and the US export to China is similar, although the degrees of these drivers are different. This study does not only focus on the decoupling of carbon emissions embodied in the Sino-US trade but also provides a research framework for the decoupling of carbon emissions embodied in global trade, especially trade between developing and developed countries.},

Yet the resulting impacts on carbon dioxide emissions and ambient particulate matter (PM2.5) related premature mortality are unclear. Here we show that in contrast to a free trade world, with the emission intensity in each sector unchanged, an extremely anti-trade scenario with current tariffs plus an additional 25% tariff on each traded product would reduce the global export volume by 32.5%, gross domestic product by 9.0%, carbon dioxide by 6.3%, and PM2.5-related mortality by 4.1%. The respective impacts would be substantial for the United States, Western Europe and China. A freer trade scenario would increase global carbon dioxide emission and air pollution due to higher levels of production, especially in developing regions with relatively high emission intensities. Global collaborative actions to reduce emission intensities in developing regions could help achieve an economic-environmental win-win state through globalization.},

   abstract = {The new age of trade wars could simultaneously affect the worldwide distribution pattern of the economy and environmental emissions. However, previous studies have focused on economic impacts, and on trade liberalization, while little is known about the equilibrium effects of trade barriers on the environment. Using a global computable general equilibrium model and taking the recent anti-trade policies of the Trump administration as an example, this study investigates the possible socio-economic and environmental effects of trade friction. Specifically, this study explores how the implemented six rounds of China-US trade friction and its different long-term development trends affect regional economic output, GHG and air pollutant emissions. Results show that trade barriers harm both countries' economies and such losses have a certain permanence, while non-participants can benefit indirectly. Trade friction decreases participants' GHG emissions, modifies global GHG emission distribution patterns, and leads to improved air quality in most countries. If governments continue to impose tariffs, global GHG emissions could counterfactually decrease by up to 5%. However, the change in trade patterns is not conducive to clean energy development in the less-developed regions, including the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America, and emission reductions from trade friction are insufficient to avoid catastrophic climate change.

This study built a multiregional computable general equilibrium model to simulate environmental impacts of the "US-China trade war" under different scenarios of tariff and nontariff barriers and the battlefield spreading ranges. The present study found that although the trade war will cause a global economic downturn, which will seemingly reduce environmental pressure globally, global carbon emissions are expected to increase rather than decline. On the one hand, the CO2 emission increase caused by land-use changes in Brazil and Argentina will far exceed the emission reduction because of decreased global production. On the other hand, some countries/economies especially those developing countries such as Vietnam, Russia, and India will face emission increases driven by scale effects. Countries such as Korea, the UK, and France will enjoy a reduction in emissions driven by structural effects. China and the US will face a reduction in production and CO2 emissions, but their CO2 emission intensities will rise. The results remind us that as global production and supply chains are formed, it is important to closely monitor trade-related environmental impacts. Efforts should be made to balance the interests of trade and the environment.},
