	abstract = {Past studies related to embodied pollutant accounting reported that free trade has increased the environmental pollution of developing economies, because the developed countries "outsource " their pollutants to developing nations. The COVID-19 pandemic has stimulated the rise of the most serious protectionism after World War II. This study is aimed to discuss whether protectionism improve the environment in developing countries by developing a comprehensive evaluation model, which integrates multi-regional input-output (MRIO), data envelopment analysis (DEA), and scenario analysis. We revealed the role of protectionism from two perspectives: the single impact on pollutant emissions and the comprehensive impact on environmental efficiency. Specifically, the capital inputs, labor inputs, energy consumption, economic output, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides emissions related to global trade activities were simulated based on the MRIO. And then, sector-level trade environmental efficiency was computed by intergrading the MRIO and DEA using a non-radial directional distance function. Finally, the environmental efficiency of both developing and developed countries under two scenarios with and without trade were estimated. The results confirmed that trade has increased the CO2, SO2 and NOX emissions of developing economies by 12.9{\%}, 9.8{\%} and 12.3{\%}, and has reduced that of developed economies by 6.0{\%}, 29.4{\%} and 21.2{\%}, respectively. However, the results also uncovered that the environmental efficiency of developing and developed economies was dropped by 3{\%} and 5{\%}, respectively, under no-trade scenario. We contend that protectionism is not conducive to the sustainable development of developing countries because it lowers their environmental efficiency, although it may reduce their territorial pollutant emissions. For developed countries, the single impact of protectionism on pollutant emission reduction and the comprehensive impact on environmental efficiency are both negative.(c) 2022 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

@article{production_fragmentation_and_inter-provincial_trade_water_china,
	abstract = {Freshwater resources are used to produce commodities that are traded and consumed elsewhere, which generate virtual water flows. The relation between regional blue water scarcity levels-the degree of competition over limited surface and groundwater flows-and inter-regional virtual water flows has been studied. However, the effects of production fragmentation on this relation are still not properly understood. Production fragmentation is the distribution of the production process across different regions, resulting in inter-regional trade of both intermediate and finished goods and services, which involve different virtual water networks. This study formulates a comprehensive trade disaggregation approach to elaborate the virtual water networks of three trade patterns (i.e., direct final goods trade, intermediate goods trade for the last step of production, and value chain related trade) within China, and further analyzes the impacts of trade on provincial blue water scarcity by comparing the actual water scarcity with that under a "no-trade " scenario (NTS). In 2012, there was 128 km(3) blue water virtually transferred across provinces because of inter-provincial trade. Direct final goods trade contributed the most to the virtual water trade (accounting for 47{\%} of the total), whereas value chain-related trade induced the least (17{\%}). Compared with the results under the NTS, we found that current trade alleviated the water scarcity in provinces under extreme water scarcity, but worsened the water scarcity of this nation from a broader scope. Our study suggests policy makers fully considering specific trade patterns and their impacts on provincial or national water consumption to cope with water scarcity in China.},

@article{China's_inter-provincial_trade,
	abstract = {Assessing progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is among the most pressing areas for sustainability research. Both international and inter-provincial trade has substantial impacts on sustainability. However, little is known about the impacts of inter-provincial trade on progress towards achieving the SDG targets and the relationships among SDG indicators through time and space. Here we, taking Chinese inter-provincial trade as a study case, used a spatiotemporal approach and the multi-regional input-output (MRIO) model to examine changes in six SDG indicators and their relationships within China in the year 2002, 2007, 2010, 2012, 2015, and 2017. The results showed that (1) Chinese inter-provincial trade improved the trade-related SDG target scores of 16 provinces out of the evaluated 30 provinces but reduced the trade-related SDG target scores of the remaining 14 provinces. (2) Chinese inter-provincial trade and distant trade were more beneficial for achieving the trade-related SDG targets in developed provinces (e.g., Beijing), which thus improved China's overall SDG target scores. In contrast, Chinese inter-provincial trade suppressed the trade-related SDG target scores of developing provinces (e.g., Guangxi). (3) Individual SDG indicators, SDG target bundles, and interactions among SDG indicators changed across both time and space. (4) The no-trade scenario in Hubei province during the COVID-19 pandemic will have a clearly inhibiting effect on China's overall SDG target scores. Besides, trade with adjacent provinces would improve Hubei's SDG target scores, while these trades have more negative effects (approximately 50-83{\%} of provinces suffered from greater reductions in SDG target scores) on Hubei's adjacent provinces. Our study suggests the spatiotemporal dynamic characteristics of SDG indicators and their interactions deserve more attention, which can help identify the drivers behind these changing relationships.},

@article{impacts_of_US_carbon_intensity,
	abstract = {After the USA reached its carbon emission peak in 2007, the share of carbon emissions from its energy activities showed a downward trend. As a country that accounts for even close to 80{\%} of the tertiary industry, the final demands from other industries are usually met by other countries in the form of international trade. While trade is realizing economic transfer, it also realizes the transfer of carbon emissions to a certain extent, helping the country achieve the peaks. From the perspective of combining carbon emission transfer and economic transfer, are there transfers and impacts? In this study, the quantified impact of international trade on the USA's carbon intensity has been investigated by a novel framework, based on a porposed scenario analysis using MRIO. As it gets lower aggregate carbon intensity value under trade scenario, it concludes that international trade is more conducive to the needs of this country for carbon emission reduction and economic development in general. From the different trade patterns, all of them get lower carbon intensity values under trade than no-trade scenario. From trade partners' perspectives, the positive and negative of the intensity gap cannot be kept uniform for all traders. Sectoral driving factors are decomposed by LMDI method, with the sectoral effect of aggrerate value-added structure and sectoral aggregate embodied carbon intensity. Among obvious carbon-intensive sectors, transport sectors always show a negative effect for the gap, and heavy manufacturing and electricity sectors usually give positive effects. As a major trading country in the world, trade and exchanges with other countries are more conducive to this country with a lower carbon intensity, and it also requires the country to shoulder coresponding responsiblities as a great power while enjoying the benefies. It is conducive to the further strengthening of unity of the international community, to jointly address the challenges of climate change and achieve the subsequent carbon neutral targets.},

@article{Trade_Protection_Trigger_a_Surge,
	abstract = {Current research has revealed that global trade promotes transnational investment and contributes to large amounts of CO2 emissions. Recently, trade protectionism has gradually emerged. This study aims to explore the effect of global trade protection on investment-related CO2 emissions. We construct an accounting framework for investment-related CO2 emissions under trade freedom and trade restriction based on the MRIO model for the first time, and investment-related CO2 emissions in 16 economies are determined in both trade freedom and trade restriction scenarios. The study uses normal trade and no-trade scenarios instead of free trade and restricted trade scenarios. Then, based on the comparison of the two scenarios, the effect of global trade protection on investment-related CO2 emissions is revealed from the three levels of country, section, and trade links. It is found that global trade protection would lead to an increase of up to 546.17 million tons in investment-related CO2 emissions under current trade structures. Transnational investment in the trade of end-stage intermediary goods contributed 81.6{\%} of the total effect. In terms of countries, trade protection is quite disadvantageous to CO2 emission reduction in China and India, and their CO2 emissions would respectively increase by 105 million tons and 141.5 million tons compared to normal trade. The electricity, gas, and water supply sectors and the manufacturing sector are the main sectors for investment-related CO2 emissions. This study reveals the effect of trade freedom and trade protection on the environment of various countries from the viewpoint of investment-related CO2 emissions, which has important reference value for global CO2 emission reduction in the context of the evolving trade situation.},
