   abstract = {We analyze the greenhouse gas emissions embodied in trade between Japan and the US, extending the Japanese government's linked Japan-US input-output model to include carbon emission coefficients for each sector. We estimate that in 1995, Japan-US trade reduced US industrial emissions by 14.6 million tons of CO2-equivalent, and increased emissions in Japan by 6.7 million tons, for a global savings of 7.9 million tons. These quantities are less than one percent of each country's total emissions. Trade with the rest of the world reduced emissions by much larger amounts, roughly four percent of each country's emissions. The sectoral patterns of carbon intensity are strongly correlated between Japan and the US; in addition, greater carbon intensity has a small but significantly positive effect on net exports. Policies that tax or otherwise regulate carbon emissions are needed to discourage this destructive route to competitiveness. However, the most important policy implication may be that US industry could cut its carbon emissions by more than half if it matched the environmental performance of industry in Japan.

   abstract = {Measuring the performance of environmentally sustainable supply chains instead of chain constitute has become a challenge despite the convergence of the underlining principles of sustainable supply chain management. This challenge is exacerbated by the fact that supply chains are inherently dynamic and complex and also because multiple measures can be used to characterize performances. By identifying some of the critical issues in the literature regarding performance measurements, this paper contributes to the existing body of literature by adopting an environmental performance measurement approach for economic sectors. It uses economic sectors and evaluates them on a sectoral level in specific countries as well as part of the Global Value Chain based on the established multi-regional input-output (MRIO) modeling framework. The MRIO model has been used to calculate direct and indirect (that is supply chain or upstream) environmental effects such as CO2, SO2, biodiversity, water consumption and pollution to name just a few of the applications. In this paper we use MRIO analysis to calculate emissions and resource consumption intensities and footprints, direct and indirect impacts, and net emission flows between countries. These are exemplified by using carbon emissions, sulphur oxide emissions and water use in two highly polluting industries; Electricity production and Chemical industry in 33 countries, including the EU-27, Brazil, India and China, the USA, Canada and Japan from 1995 to 2009. Some of the highlights include: On average, direct carbon emissions in the electricity sector across all 27 member states of the EU was estimated to be 1368 million tons and indirect carbon emissions to be 470.7 million tons per year representing 25.6% of the EU-27 total carbon emissions related to this sector. It was also observed that from 2004, sulphur oxide emissions intensities in electricity production in-India and China have remained relatively constant at about 62.8 gSO(x)/, respectively, $ and 84.4 gSO(x)/$ although being higher than in other countries. In terms of water use, the high water use intensity in China (1040.27 L/$) and India (961.63 L/$), which are among the highest in the sector in the electricity sector is exacerbated by both countries being ranked as High Water Stress Risk countries. The paper also highlights many advantages of the MRIO approach including: a 15-year time series study (which provides a measurement of environmental performance of key industries and an opportunity to assess technical and technological change during the investigated time period), a supply chain approach that provides a consistent methodological framework and accounts for all upstream supply chain environmental impacts throughout entire global supply chains. The paper also discusses the implications of the study to environmental sustainability performance measurement in terms of the level of analysis from a value chain hierarchy perspective, methodological issues, performance indicators, environmental exchanges and policy relevance.

   abstract = {The methodology proposed in this paper allows us to parcel the pollution haven hypothesis (PHH) into a bi-regional input-output framework to analyse whether the specialisation of countries in different stages of production and/or in final goods trading generates an increase or a decrease in global emissions as a consequence of international trade. We apply the model to the Spain-China trade relationship as it existed in 2005, finding a PHH of 29,667 KtCO(2). If this trade had not existed (so each country had met its demand for intermediate and final goods), global emissions would have been reduced by these 29,667 KtCO(2). Of this PHH, 43.5% corresponds to imports of final goods; 32.4% is related to imports of intermediate goods for the last stage of production; the remainder, 24.1%, is caused by global value chains (GVC) between the countries. Only 3229 KtCO(2) of PHH emissions are linked to domestic emissions from the sector in which the imports are produced; the rest is explained by domestic linkages or successive rounds of domestic production, which supports the existence of an indirect PHH. Together with a trade growth in the last years, the fall of trade barriers would have implied a transformation of global production chains that have boosted global emissions. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {Free trade agreements are currently receiving much attention in the media and politics. One important question concerning free trade is its effect on the environment, for example in carbon dioxide emissions. The goal of this paper is to provide evidence on the validity of the pollution haven hypothesis using a multi-regional input-output approach for six regions and the rest of the world as a whole. Our findings indicate that in the period from 1995 to 2009, international trade has allowed the global economy to reduce its overall CO2 emissions, compared to a hypothetical situation without international trade. The total amount of emissions saved was 15.06 Gt in the period under consideration. However, not all of the seven regions in our model have been able to reduce their CO2 emissions through trade. Global value chains have led to China becoming a pollution haven for other regions and its exports have increased world emissions to 1.28 Gt CO2 in 2008. However, what allows a net saving of emissions on a global scale is the supply of energy and natural resources from a set of peripheral economies, which in our geographical categorization are mostly integrated in the region of the rest of the world.

   abstract = {Net Emissions Avoided by trade (NEA) are the difference between the pollution that would have been produced in a country if it had not exported any products and all the imports required to satisfy its domestic demand had been produced internally, and its actual emissions. The Domestic Technology Assumption (DTA) applied to an Input-Output model is the appropriate method to estimate the NEA. The usual implementation of the DTA involves that the country analyzed should produce a quantity of products equivalent to the monetary value of the imports required to satisfy its final demand (i.e. 'monetary DTA'). However, due to price differences, the same physical quantity of goods in different countries could have a different monetary value and the estimation of the NEA would be biased. We show that a 'physical DTA', focused on the pollution to produce domestically the imports measured in physical units, would be a better approach. We have applied both methodologies to analyze greenhouse gas emissions in Spain 1995-2007. Both methodologies show that Spain is avoiding emissions through trade. However, the NEA increases up to three times when applying the 'physical DTA', showing that results from the 'monetary DTA' are biased by price differences. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {Sustainability, the consideration of environmental factors and social aspects, in supply chain management (SCM) has become a highly relevant topic for researchers and practitioners. The application of operations research methods and related models, i.e. formal modeling, for closed-loop SCM and reverse logistics has been effectively reviewed in previously published research. This situation is in contrast to the understanding and review of mathematical models that focus on environmental or social factors in forward supply chains (SC), which has seen less investigation. To evaluate developments and directions of this research area, this paper provides a content analysis of 134 carefully identified papers on quantitative, formal models that address sustainability aspects in the forward SC. It was found that a preponderance of the publications and models appeared in a limited set of six journals, and most were analytically based with a focus on multiple criteria decision making. The tools most often used comprise the analytical hierarchy process or its close relative, the analytical network process, as well as life cycle analysis. Conclusions are drawn showing that numerous possibilities and insights can be gained from expanding the types of tools and factors considered in formal modeling efforts. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Much attention has been focused on the CO2 directly emitted by each country, but relatively little attention has been paid to the amount of emissions associated with the consumption of goods and services in each country. Consumption-based accounting of CO2 emissions differs from traditional, production-based inventories because of imports and exports of goods and services that, either directly or indirectly, involve CO2 emissions. Here, using the latest available data, we present a global consumption-based CO2 emissions inventory and calculations of associated consumption-based energy and carbon intensities. We find that, in 2004, 23% of global CO2 emissions, or 6.2 gigatonnes CO2, were traded internationally, primarily as exports from China and other emerging markets to consumers in developed countries. In some wealthy countries, including Switzerland, Sweden, Austria, the United Kingdom, and France, > 30% of consumption-based emissions were imported, with net imports to many Europeans of > 4 tons CO2 per person in 2004. Net import of emissions to the United States in the same year was somewhat less: 10.8% of total consumption-based emissions and 2.4 tons CO2 per person. In contrast, 22.5% of the emissions produced in China in 2004 were exported, on net, to consumers elsewhere. Consumption-based accounting of CO2 emissions demonstrates the potential for international carbon leakage. Sharing responsibility for emissions among producers and consumers could facilitate international agreement on global climate policy that is now hindered by concerns over the regional and historical inequity of emissions.},

As recent studies have found substantial amounts of carbon dioxide and air pollution embedded in the global supply chains, the Sino-US trade war may also affect emissions and health burdens worldwide, which remains poorly understood. Here, we estimate the potential changes in gross domestic product (GDP), anthropogenic emissions and particulate matter (PM2.5) related premature deaths worldwide under two Sino-US trade war scenarios. We find that for the US and China, the trade war would reduce their GDP and, less significantly, emissions and mortality, suggesting that the trade war is not an effective means of environmental protection. The trade war would increase both GDP and mortality in many developing regions, because of their increased production of goods targeted in the Sino-US trade war. Surprisingly, Western Europe and Latin America and Caribbean would have higher GDP but lower emissions and mortality, an economic and environmental win-win outcome as a net result of the complex changes in the global supply chains. Neighbour regions of the US and China such as Canada, Japan and Korea would also have higher GDP but lower mortality, because of reduced atmospheric transboundary transport from the US and China overcompensating for increased local emissions of these neighbours. The complex consequences of the Sino-US trade war highlight the strong inter-regional and economic-environmental linkage in support of a global collaborative strategy to foster economic growth and environmental protection.},

   abstract = {Meeting Sub-Saharan African (SSA) human development goals will require economic development to be the priority over the coming decades, but economic development 'at all cost' may not be acceptable across these goals. This paper aims to explore five development scenarios for the five largest economies in SSA to understand the implications to CO2-equivalent emissions (CO2-e) and off-grid energy modernisation in 2030. Within this scope GDP growth; economic structure; availability of energy resources; international trade; and, the development of distributed generation for remote locations are considered. Regional CO2 emissions were studied using a Multi-Regional Input-Output Model for Africa. Under the scenarios analysed all five nations will be unable to reduce 2030 CO2-e emissions below 2012 levels, whilst simultaneously achieving forecast GDP growth and universal access to modernised energy services. 100% off-grid modernisation is estimated to require a three-fold increase in Primary Energy Supply and a 26% (1317 Mt) increase in 2030 CO2-e emissions. Total regional CO2-e emissions could be reduced from 45% to 35% by meeting a 50% renewable energy supply target by 2030. Climate Change policy would need to focus on multi-sector reform to reduce regional emissions as the agricultural sector is the largest emitter in Nigeria, Ethiopia and Kenya.},

   abstract = {Mercury (Hg) pollution control has become an urgent need at global and national scales. This study, for the first time, comprehensively examines Hg flows in Mainland China and uncovers domestic and external causal drivers of China's Hg emissions/releases. Results show that China's Hg input reaches 2643 tin 2010. China discharges 1368 t of Hg to the environment (to air, 633 t; water, 84 t; and land, 651 t). Embedded Hg transfers across production sectors via waste/byproduct flows reduce Hg releases to land, but lead- to secondary Hg emissions to air. Such revelations of embedded Hg transfers adjusts China's comprehensive Hg control-that would otherwise only tackle primary emitters. Domestic consumption causes 67% of China's Hg emissions/releases, and external consumption induces the remaining 33%. Besides traditional production-side Hg control measures, demand-side measures and international joint efforts are required to effectively combat Hg pollution. Uncovering embedded and embodied Hg flows within the global economy can assist a paradigm shift necessary to make real progress in global Hg control and the implementation of the Minamata Convention on Mercury.},

This paper presents an empirical study on embodied air pollution displacement of China-BR trade by employing a multi-region input-output model. Embodied air pollution trade and its transfer pattern, as well as the driving force for changes in China's trade embodied air pollution intensity, are investigated. We found that, in the period of analysis, embodied air pollution displacement between China and the BR countries was aggravated and China was in embodied air pollution trade surplus. Most net transfer mainly came from its energy importers with better air quality and higher Human Development Index. This indicated that the net embodied air pollution transfer from the BR countries to China would not bring significant environmental and sustainability impacts on those suppliers. However, embodied air pollution flowed from the BR countries to China decreased the overall environmental performance and efficiency. Decomposition analysis showed technology effect served the main force driving force for the drops in China's trade embodied air pollution intensity. The findings are beneficial for policymakers of the BR countries to take measures to promote their sustainable development. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Mercury emissions from nonferrous metal production have overtaken that from energy consumption as the leading contributor of global anthropogenic mercury emissions. Though Minamata Convention has put restrictions on import or export of mercury-added products, the inter-connected global economy that features an intensive correlated supply chain still has large impacts on mercury emissions. Therefore, this study aims to track global nonferrous metal related mercury emission flows among 186 individual economies for the year of 2010, by applying an empirically validated multi-regional input-output (MRIO) model. The total amount of direct mercury emissions is 974 tonnes, to which gold production contributed a dominant proportion. However, a spectacular 2/3 of mercury emissions from nonferrous metal production were traded internationally, primarily as exports from emerging economies such as mainland China and Colombia to wealthy economies including the USA and Germany through global supply chains. Understanding the redistribution of mercury emissions along the global supply chains can facilitate international efforts to reduce mercury emissions from nonferrous metal production.

A comprehensive investigation of the relationship between structural changes and carbon emissions is essential for further policy formulation. This paper aimed to discuss the impact of structural changes on per capita carbon emissions from the four aspects of energy, trade, society and economy, while considering the effects of economic growth and energy intensity. The ordinary least squares, fully modified ordinary least squares regression analysis and Granger causality test were used to analyze the situation of 147 countries and four income groups from 1990 to 2015. The results showed that at the global level, economic growth and economic structure were respectively the most significant positive and negative factors affecting carbon emissions. There was the bidirectional granger causality relationship between global per capita carbon emissions and economic growth, and between global per capita carbon emissions and economic struc-ture. At the income group level, consistent with the global results, economic growth and energy intensity increase promoted the increase in carbon emissions, whereas increasing renewable energy consumption helped to reduce carbon emissions. The influence direction and degree of the remaining three factors differed among different income groups. In addition, the causal relationships among the variables of the income groups except the low income group were relatively complicated. Finally, policy recommenda-tions were offered to reduce per-capita carbon emission through adjusting economic, energy, social, and trade structure. (C) 2021 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

   abstract = {The pollution paradise hypothesis states that international trade shifts pollution from developed countries to developing countries, ignoring the positive effects that the participation of developed countries in international trade has on the reduction of carbon emissions. To evaluate a country's contribution to carbon reduction comprehensively, this paper constructed a framework for calculating carbon emissions in two trade scenarios using a multi-regional input-output model. It took Germany as an example, analyzing it at global, national, and sectoral levels. The main findings were as follows: firstly, Germany's contributions to the reduction of emissions may have been underestimated. Without Germany, global embodied CO2 emissions would have increased by 1.53% on average during the research period. Secondly, Germany's participation in international trade contributed to carbon reduction in developing countries, particularly China and Russia. This was due to the lower intensity of Germany's carbon emissions. Finally, at the sectoral level, changes to carbon emissions in different trade scenarios mainly came from "manufacturing" and "electricity, gas and water supplies". As a result, corresponding policy suggestions were proposed. Studying Germany confirmed that trade protectionism did not benefit the environment and free trade was a better choice. However, more evidence is required to see whether this conclusion would be true for other countries.},

A cogent assessment of mercury emissions is required to help implement the Minamata Convention. Here, we use an environmentally extended multi-regional inputoutput model to calculate atmospheric mercury footprints of nations based on upstream production (meaning direct emissions from the production activities of a nation), downstream production (meaning both direct and indirect emissions caused by the production activities of a nation), and consumption (meaning both direct and indirect emissions caused by final consumption of goods and services in a nation). Results show that nations function differently within global supply chains. Developed nations usually have larger consumption-based emissions than up- and downstream production-based emissions. India, South Korea, and Taiwan have larger downstream production-based emissions than their upstream production- and consumption-based emissions. Developed nations (e.g., United States, Japan, and Germany) are in part responsible for mercury emissions of developing nations (e.g., China, India, and Indonesia). Our findings indicate that global mercury abatement should focus on multiple stages of global supply chains. We propose three initiatives for global mercury abatement, comprising the establishment of mercury control technologies of upstream producers, productivity improvement of downstream producers, and behavior optimization of final consumers.},

Recent years, environmentally extended multi-regional inputoutput tables (EEMRIO) are emerged to reveal regional environment impact considering upstream supply chains crossing regional boundaries. However, city-scale MRIO has not been fully addressed since more focus has been located on national or prefectural level evaluation. For quantifying city-scale emission considering regional energy flow, we apply the input-output table of Tokyo to evaluate energy consumption at the city scale, and the results provides one of the the most detailed sector classification from a wide range of city emission studies. In Japan, Tokyo is considered to be representative of the contemporary Japanese urban energy structure, and its energy consumption and associated CO2 emissions are of major importance when making city-scale carbon mitigation policies. Here, domestic production for Tokyo and other regions is used to quantify the direct and indirect emissions arising from Tokyo final consumption. Our results are divided into sector-specific and fossil fuel source-specific (coal, crude oil, and natural gas) for both direct and indirect emissions. The major findings are as follows: (1) The transportation sector accounts for the largest share of direct emissions in Tokyo. (2) The energy supply, construction, private service sectors account for the largest share of indirect emissions in Tokyo. (3) There are three scopes of emission responsibility evaluated in this study: direct emission before allocation (BE) as 12.88 MtC, after allocation (AE) as 18.91 MtC, and the total including indirect emissions is 27.24 MtC, which is more than twice the direct emissions before allocation. The detailed and energy consumption and emission inventory may be essential for emission responsibility allocation to overcome geographical boundary, therefore, contributes to varied scales of carbon reduction policies.},

   abstract = {Residential consumption produces carbon emissions through the combustion of primary energy (directly) as well as through the consumption of goods and services (indirectly). To capture the latter indirect emissions, it is common to use producer-price based input-output analysis associated with household monetary expenditures. However, producer-price input-output tables usually do not account for economic transactions and energy flows at the margin. To better understand household indirect emissions from the purchaser perspective, there is a need for a modified input-output modeling approach. To that end, this study attempts to measure the carbon footprint of households in the Tokyo Metropolis, Japan by integrating monthly household consumption inventories into an input-output table of Tokyo. By doing so, the carbon footprint was estimated to be 0.76 tC per household and the total estimated marginal carbon emissions for Tokyo is up to 0.56 MtC. A sectoral breakdown of the total emission coefficients is provided based on purchaser prices and temporal variations in emissions. Findings indicate that within household consumption, Clothing and Services categories contributed most to marginal emissions. The conclusions drawn in this paper are pertinent and policy relevant because they provide relatively accurate information compared to the status quo to inform appropriate policies for guiding residential consumption at the city scale of resolution.},

Here we show trade among developing nations (i.e., South-South trade) has more than doubled between 2004 and 2011, which reflects a new phase of globalization. Some production activities are relocating from China and India to other developing countries, particularly raw materials and intermediate goods production in energy-intensive sectors. In turn, the growth of CO2 emissions embodied in Chinese exports has slowed or reversed, while the emissions embodied in exports from less-developed regions such as Vietnam and Bangladesh have surged. Although China's emissions may be peaking, ever more complex supply chains are distributing energy-intensive industries and their CO2 emissions throughout the global South. This trend may seriously undermine international efforts to reduce global emissions that increasingly rely on rallying voluntary contributions of more, smaller, and less-developed nations.},

As a measure of a nation's contribution to this potential damage, a country's nitrogen footprint has been defined as the quantity of reactive nitrogen emitted during the production, consumption and transportation of commodities consumed within that country, whether those commodities are produced domestically or internationally(3). Here we use global emissions databases(4,5), a global nitrogen cycle model(6), and a global input-output database of domestic and international trade(7,8) to calculate the nitrogen footprints for 188 countries as the sum of emissions of ammonia, nitrogen oxides and nitrous oxide to the atmosphere, and of nitrogen potentially exportable to water bodies. Per-capita footprints range from under 7 kg N yr(-1) in some developing countries to over 100 kg N yr(-1) in some wealthy nations. Consumption in China, India, the United States and Brazil is responsible for 46% of global emissions. Roughly a quarter of the global nitrogen footprint is from commodities that were traded across country borders. The main net exporters have significant agricultural, food and textile exports, and are often developing countries, whereas important net importers are almost exclusively developed economies. We conclude that substantial local nitrogen pollution is driven by demand from consumers in other countries.},

   abstract = {Quantifying environmental load displacement from developed countries (the North) to developing countries (the South) is of particular importance for understanding the environmental implications of consumption in the North and global sustainability. Based on a global input-output model, this paper estimates emissions transfers between the North and the South for eight types of air pollutants from a consumption perspective, with a focus on emissions transfers between the North and China. The results show that 14%-30% of air pollutant emissions in the South were caused by consumption in the North in 2007. There is a large 'pollution deficit' between the North and South, which significantly increased during the period 1995-2007, that favors the theory of ecologically unequal exchange. Although the emissions per capita of the North from production for most air pollutants decreased over this period, the emissions per capita from consumption increased or decreased more mildly. The decomposition of emissions transfers further shows that South-South trade in intermediates has played an increasingly important role in environmental load displacement from the North to the South. It is important to assess the sustainability of so-called 'weightless economies' in the North from a global perspective that takes environmental load displacement into account. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {A simple and minimal criterion for sustainability is that the value of natural capital plus manufactured capital be not decreasing. On the basis of any individual country or region, the above simple comparison may be misleading, as it does not take account of the production of goods for consumption in other countries/regions, via international trade. In other terms, the full 'environmental footprint' of a country may not be properly assessed. A method of calculating a weak sustainability criterion has been established for both a 'closed' economy approach and an 'open economy approach. There are significant differences between the open and closed economies measures for several regions, particularly the Middle East. Overall, global sustainability on this criterion has been positive, and increasing. Using a difference equation approach, a further analysis has been made of the average proportional rate of change of global sustainability between 1980 and 1990, and its various regional and structural components have been determined. These indicate that most of global sustainability growth can be attributed to Western Europe, Other Asia and Japan, particularly through high savings ratios. The USA, on the other hand, has made a very small net contribution to the growth in global sustainability. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

We analyse the potential co-benefits for SO2, NOx, particulate matter (PM) and CO2 emission reduction in major industrial sectors in China. We construct and analyse a firm-level database covering nearly 80 observations and use scenario simulations to estimate the co-benefits. The findings show that substantial co-benefits could be achieved with three specific interventions. Energy intensity improvement can reduce SO2, NOx, PM and CO2 emissions for non-power sectors by 26-44%, 19-44%, 25-46% and 18-50%, respectively. Reductions from scale structure adjustment such as phasing out small firms and developing large ones can amount to 1-8%, 1-6%, 2-20% and 0.2-3%. Electrification can reduce emissions by 19-25%, 4-28%, 20-29% and 11-12% if the share of electricity generated from non-fossil fuel sources is 70%. Since firm heterogeneity is essential to realize the co-benefits and directly determines the magnitudes of these benefits, stricter and sensible environmental policies targeting industrial firms can accelerate China's sustainable transformation.},

The model provides a consistent analysis of the global production system, representing geographical location at a regional level, region-specific technologies at a sector level, emissions from production, and resource constraints and costs. An illustrative analysis investigates how changes in the geographic distribution of production could contribute to reducing global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and at what cost. The model provides a bridge between global objectives and their determinants and consequences in specific sectors in individual regions. Multi-objective analysis is used to construct a trade-off curve between global factor costs and CO2 emissions. The relevance of both primal and dual solution variables is demonstrated. In particular, changes in goods prices and emissions are investigated. We conclude that the main impact of tightening carbon constraints is a substantial reduction in international trade accompanied by a shift away from regions most reliant on the combustion of coal. In addition to the analysis of the overall global trends, including the impact on prices, the implications of the global carbon constraint for one specific industry are investigated.},

   abstract = {This study systematically summarizes previous research efforts on Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) applied to energy and environment in the past four decades, including concepts and methodologies on DEA environmental assessment. Industrial developments are very important for all nations in terms of their economic prosperities. A problem is that the development produces various pollutions on air, water and other types of contaminations, all of which are usually associated with our health problems and climate changes. Thus, it is necessary for us to consider how to make a balance between economic success and pollution mitigation to maintain a high level of social sustainability in the world. It is widely considered that DEA is one of the methodologies to examine the level of sustainability. This study examines a recent research trend on DEA applications from 1980s to 2010s. Nowadays, many researchers have paid serious attention on how to combat various difficulties in the areas of energy and environment.As a result, the number of artides on DEA applications on energy and environment has dramatically increased, particularly after 2000s. However, it is true that DEA has strengths and drawbacks in the applications. Therefore, it is very important for us to carefully use DEA for guiding large policy issues and business strategies such as the global warming and climate change. An underlying premise of this study is that technology innovation in engineering and natural science may solve various problems by linking it with political and managerial efforts. The use of DEA provides a methodological linkage among them, so enhancing the practicality in mitigating problems due to climate change and environmental pollutions. This literature study, along with a summary on conceptual and methodological developments, provides us with guidelines for our future research works on DEA on energy and environment issues.

   abstract = {Because human activities emit greenhouse gases (GHGs) and conventional air pollutants from common sources, policy designed to reduce GHGs can have co-benefits for air quality that may offset some or all of the near-term costs of GHG mitigation. We present a systems approach to quantify air quality co-benefits of US policies to reduce GHG (carbon) emissions. We assess health-related benefits from reduced ozone and particulate matter (PM2.5) by linking three advanced models, representing the full pathway from policy to pollutant damages. We also examine the sensitivity of co-benefits to key policy-relevant sources of uncertainty and variability. We find that monetized human health benefits associated with air quality improvements can offset 261,050% of the cost of US carbon policies. More flexible policies that minimize costs, such as cap-and-trade standards, have larger net co-benefits than policies that target specific sectors (electricity and transportation). Although air quality co-benefits can be comparable to policy costs for present-day air quality and near-term US carbon policies, potential co-benefits rapidly diminish as carbon policies become more stringent.},

This study provided a new way to investigate the impact of the pandemic on carbon emissions by calculating the difference between the pandemic-free carbon emissions and the actual carbon emissions in 2020 based on scenario analysis. In this work, derived from Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) method and Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) method, two combined ARIMA-BPNN and BPNN-ARIMA simulation approaches were developed to simulate the carbon emissions of China, India, U.S. and EU under the pandemic-free scenario. The average relative error of the simulation was about 1%, which could provide reliable simulation results. The scenario simulation of carbon emission reduction in the US and EU were almost the same as the inter-annual change rate of carbon emissions reported by the existing statistics. However, the scenario simulation of carbon emission reduction in China and India is 5% larger than the inter-annual change rate of carbon emissions reported by the existing statistics. In some sense, the impact of the pandemic on carbon emission reduction in developing countries might be underestimated. This work would provide new sight to more comprehensive understanding of the impact of the pandemic on carbon emissions.},

   abstract = {The growth of global carbon emissions is largely driven by coal-burning in China. China has consumed approximately half of global coal; as such, limiting its coal demand is important for curbing carbon emissions in the country and around the world. Developing effective approaches to limit China's coal demand requires comprehensively understanding the trajectory and drivers shaping its coal footprint in the globalized world. Past studies have investigated production-based coal consumption within China's sovereign territory boundary, but have not addressed consumption-based coal consumption and the globalization background. To fill this research gap, this study conducted a multi-regional input-output analysis- structural decomposition analysis to analyze China's coal footprint in a globalized world. The results show a continued rise in the influence of globalization on China's coal consumption, despite the 1997 Asian financial crisis and 2008-09 global economic crisis lowering of global trade. The percentage of other countries' coal demand on China's production-based coal footprint increased from 20% in 1995 to nearly 30% in 2011, through a global transfer of virtual coal through trade. Virtual coal refers to the coal consumed to support production activities. Meanwhile, the impact of other countries' coal supply on China's consumption-based coal footprint increased from less than 2% in 1995 to more than 4% in 2011. However, the decomposition results showed that domestic demand was the leading contributor to Chinese production-based and consumption-based coal footprint. This was offset by the domestic coal intensity effect. To cut China's coal, strategies to cap its total coal consumption should be considered in a globalized world. Improving energy intensity is an effective approach for the country; China should be leveraging the globalized world, rather than serving as the world's factory through high coal consumption and exports.

The traditional environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis explains the inverted Ushaped relationship between the economy and the environment. This study expands the traditional EKC theory by adding social indicator, which also corresponds to the three aspects (social, economic, and environmental) required for sustainable development in 2030. Based on the panel data of 134 countries from 1996 to 2015, the threshold regression model is applied to investigate the non-linear causality between the variables. The threshold variable is urbanization, and the impact mechanism of economic growth on carbon dioxide emissions and ecological footprint is tested. The results show that: urbanization strengthens the positive correlation between the economy and carbon emissions and ecological footprint. The positive effect of economic growth on the ecological footprint is greater than that of carbon emissions. Trade openness and natural resource rents increase environmental pressure. Population aging and renewable energy improve the quality of the environment. There is heterogeneity in the values and change trend of the regression coefficients of different income groups. Unlike the coefficient growth trend in the results of all countries, the following situations occur. As urbanization successively crosses the threshold, the positive effect of economic growth on carbon dioxide emissions in high income countries diminishes. The coefficient of the lower middle income group has an inverted U-shape. When the ecological footprint is the explained variable, the coefficient of the high income group becomes U-shaped.},

   abstract = {International trade interacts with Sustainable Development Goal targets in profound ways. This study finds that while trade improves scores for environmental Sustainable Development Goals in developed countries, it decreases them in developing countries, and distant trade is a bigger contributor to scores than adjacent trade between countries. The United Nations has adopted 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with 169 targets. International trade has substantial influences on global sustainability and human well-being. However, little is known about the impacts of international trade on progress towards achieving the SDG targets. Here we show that international trade positively affected global progress towards achieving nine environment-related SDG targets. International trade improved the SDG target scores of most (65%) of the evaluated developed countries but reduced the SDG target scores of over 60% of the evaluated developing countries. The SDG target scores of developed countries were higher than those of developing countries when trade was accounted for, but those scores would be lower than those of developing countries if trade were not a factor. Furthermore, trade between distant countries contributed more to achieving these global SDG targets than trade between adjacent countries. Compared with adjacent trade, distant trade was more beneficial for achieving SDG targets in developed countries, but it more negatively affected SDG target scores in developing countries. Our research suggests that enhancing the accounting for and management of virtual resources embedded in trade is essential for achieving and balancing sustainable development for all.},

Although studies have shown that regionally disaggregated model and model that distinguishes processing exports at the national level are necessary to estimate the embodied emissions in China's exports, no study evaluates this issue by simultaneously taking both regional and trade heterogeneity into account. To fill this gap, we re-estimate the CO2 emissions embodied in China's exports at both regional and industrial level, by using the newly-developed inter-regional input-output (IRIOP) model that distinguishes processing trade from other trade at the regional level. Results show that compared to the IRIOP model, the traditional multi-regional input-output (MRIO) model has overestimated the environmental loss from exports by 14%-25% in 2002 and 7%-20% in 2012 for different regions. The largest bias is found in regions and industries with the highest processing export shares. Therefore, the IRIOP model gives more accurate accounting on the regional environmental loss due to national exports and thus is important for establishing effective emission mitigation policies.

   abstract = {Globalization has led to an increasing geospatial separation of production and consumption, and, as a consequence, to an unprecedented displacement of environmental and social impacts through international trade. A large proportion of total global impacts can be associated with trade, and the trend is rising. Advances in global multi-region input-output models have allowed researchers to draw detailed, international supply-chain connections between harmful production in social and environmental hotspots and affluent consumption in global centres of wealth. The general direction of impact displacement is from developed to developing countries-an increase of health impacts in China from air pollution linked to export production for the United States being one prominent example. The relocation of production across countries counteracts national mitigation policies and may negate ostensible achievements in decoupling impacts from economic growth. A comprehensive implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals therefore requires the inclusion of footprint indicators to avoid loopholes in national sustainability assessments.},
